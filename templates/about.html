                    <p class="lead">In rapidly developing cities, critical infrastructure failures—from water leaks to power outages-often go unnoticed by authorities for days. Traditional complaint systems are siloed, opaque, and lack the real-time urgency required for modern urban management</p>
                    <p class="lead">CivicPulse changes the equation. By aggregating decentralized citizen reports and applying severity-based filtering, we provide city officials with a live 'health check' of their district. We don't just track issues; we visualize the pulse of the city's infrastructure to enable faster, smarter repairs.</p>
